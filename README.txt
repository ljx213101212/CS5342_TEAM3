# CS5342_TEAM2

NOTE: 
The function of our website and server side will be presented when we do our DEMO in the classroom.
The presentation will be based on our webpage, hence right now we don't offer any PPT slides. 

Environment configuration:

Apache v2.4.18
php v5.6.10
Matlab_R2015a


Documentation structure:
webapp(root):
    -function (matlab source code)
        --RR1.m (Relative Smoothness 1 entry)
        --RR2.m (Relative Smoothness 2 entry)
        --RR3.m (Reflection Change entry)
        --*....(related function for above entries)
    -php_*.php(Server-side code)
    -start.sh(matlab code invoker)
    -result*.php(result page for displaying different results)
    -index*.html(HTML5 pages)
    -js(Referenced Javascript code)
    -css(Referenced CSS code)
    -fonts
    -resource(input images)
    -result(output images)
    -DEMO_RR1-RR2(demo input images source for RR1&RR2 function)
    -DEMO_RR3(demo input images source for RR3 function)


Simple guide for test our codes
1) load this whole package/folder in MATLAB
2-1) Under '/function', run RR1.m, RR2.m respectively for testing Layer Separation based on Relative Smoothness.
2-2) Under '/function', run RR3.m for testing Layer Separation based on Separation based on Reflection Change.
3-1) Refer to '/result' for checking the output images.
3-2) Refer to '/DEMO_RR3/result' for checking the output images. 
NOTE: Each output image's name indicates the time consumption (ms).
