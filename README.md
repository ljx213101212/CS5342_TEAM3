NOTE: 
The function of our website and server side will be presented when we do our DEMO in the classroom.
The presentation will be based on our webpage, hence right now we don't offer any PPT slides. 

Simple guide for test our codes
1) load this whole package/folder in MATLAB
2-1) Under '/function', run RR1.m, RR2.m respectively for testing Layer Separation based on Relative Smoothness.
2-2) Under '/function', run RR3.m for testing Layer Separation based on Separation based on Reflection Change.
3-1) Refer to '/result' for checking the output images.
3-2) Refer to '/DEMO_RR3/result' for checking the output images. 
NOTE: Each output image's name indicates the time consumption (ms).
